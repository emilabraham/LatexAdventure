  \centerline{\emph{The Greatest Violinist}}

  "The reviewer said that Will Marion Cook was definitely 'the
  world's greatest Negro violinist'.

  Dad Cook took his violin and went to see the reviewer at the newspaper office.

  'Thank you very much for the favorable review', he said. 'You wrote that I was
  the world's greatest Negro violinist.'

  'Yes, Mr. Cook,' the man said, 'and I meant it. You are definitely the world's
  greatest Negro violinist.'

  With that, Dad Cook took out his violin and smashed it across the reviewer's
  desk.

  'I am not the world's greatest Negro violinist,' he exclaimed, 'I am the
  greatest violinist in the world!'"

  Will Marion Cook did much more than a violinist. He was a composer, conductor,
  performer, teacher, and producer. He has contributed to nearly every aspect of
  black music at his time and worked with nearly every other important musician in
  his fields. Many would consider him a Renaissance Man of his time.

  Cook was born in Washington, D.C., on January 27, 1869. His father, John
  Hartwell Cook, was dean of the liberal Law School at Howard University. After
  his father died of tuberculosis, his mother had him sent away to live with his
  grandparents in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This was obviously an overwhelming and
  unexpected chain of events for a 10-year old black child to experience. But all
  of this turned out for the better. Chattanooga, is where he first experienced
  black folk music.

  In Chattanooga, he learned the value of hard work. He worked as a farm hand on
  his grandfather's farm. One thing he never learned was discipline. When he
  caused trouble or fooled around with the girls in town(He was quite the ladies
      man), he was punished. But he never learned his lesson. He would often get
  into fights with white boys when they called him 'nigger'. He was much too proud
  to succumb to racial injustice. Eventually his
  grandfather sent him back to D.C. After experiencing the vast plains of
  Tennessee and the unique 'soul music' he made the decision of pursuing a career
  in music.

  In 1883, he studied at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio to begin his foray
  into music,
  specifically the violin. Why did he choose Oberlin? Oberlin was a pioneering
  school in a way. They were extremely for abolition, and they were one of the
  first schools to offer degrees to women. Both of Cook's parents also attended
  Oberlin. At Oberlin he was known for his stellar performances on the violin.
  He had a certain level of showmanship and expression that could only be seen
  in master violinists. Eventually his talent outgrew what his professors could
  teach him. He sought the to study abroad in Berlin. Since he didn't have the
  money at the time, he talked to Frederick Douglass for a source of funding.
  Douglass arranged a recital that raised Cook over \textdollar 2000.

  In Berlin, he studied violin at a leading music institution lead by Joseph
  Joachim, a friend of Johannes Brahms. He progressed rapidly and began to build
  a name for himself. He became fluent in German and really appreciated the
  liberal, more tolerant nature of of German culture at the time.

  In 1889 he eventually returned to America because his funds had run dry. On
  his returned, he began to start conducting; As if his mastery of the violin
  wasn't enough. He started an ensemble that saw a good deal of success. Eventually, when
  he was in his early twenties he decided to conduct and compose full time. He
  began to perform at different fairs across the country. He met many famous
  composers and experienced many different genres of music. It was at one of the
  fairs that he met the great composer Anton\'{i}n Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k.

  Will Marion Cook was introduced to Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k through a letter prompted by
  Harry T. Burleigh. Harry was another student of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k's and played a
  significant role in the development of African American Music.
  Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k's \emph{New World Symphony} was heavily influenced by
  African American and Native American melodies. He had philosophy that a
  countries classical music should be derived from the folk music of that
  country. This composition took the world by storm. In a way, having a world
  renowned composer write music based on American folk songs legitimized
  A legitimized American music and it's composers.

  How could Cook possibly impress such a famous composer? What did Cook have to
  offer this Czech  musical genius? At the time, Cook was working on
  \emph{Scenes from the Opera of Uncle Tom's Cabin}, so this is what he chose to
  present to Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k. His charm and fluency of German worked its magic
  and Cook was able to join Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k's composition class.

  Under Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k's influence, Cook learned to return to his African
  American roots. Instead of further pursuing a more classical European approach
  to composing, like he had been trained since he attended Oberlin at age 14, he
  began to compose music that relied more on classic African American folk songs
  and ragtime. His mother was often surprised as to the direction Will took in
  his path to success, "'Oh! Will! I send you all around the world so that you
  become a great musician, and you return such a Nigger!'"

  After studying with Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k at the National Conservatory for Music in
  New York for a period of time(1894-1895), he started to make popular music. He
  realized that his classical career was not making him as much money and was
  not taking him as far as he thought it would. For this reason he entered the
  world of black musical theatre. His first big musical success was
  \emph{Clorindy} or \emph{The Origin of the Cakewalk}. Many consider cakewalk
  the predecessor to ragtime. The performance of \emph{Clorindy} at the Casino
  Roof Garden was Broadway's first black musical-comedy sketch. It was the talk
  of New York at the time.

  It was during the production of \emph{Clorindy} that Will Marion Cook met his
  wife, Abbie Mitchell. She was an untrained singer who was hired to join the
  "chorus girls". Eventually, under the careful instruction of Harry T. Burleigh
  and Cook, she blossomed to eventually take on a leading role. Cook and
  Mitchell eventually got married on October 12, 1900. Abbie was 20 years
  younger than Will and didn't even have a high school education. Will's class
  conscious family often frowned upon their relationship. Regardless, Will had
  his first child, a baby girl, Marion Abigail.

  After \emph{Clorindy}, Cook went on to compose a few more musicals and
  Broadway plays: \emph{The Policy Players}, \emph{Uncle Eph's Christmas},
  \emph{The Cannibal King}. One of the more famous works that he composed the
  music for was \emph{In Dahomey}. This musical comedy is about a group of
  African Americans who, after finding a pot of gold, travel to Africa and
  eventually become rulers of Dahomey. Bert Williams, a leading black comedian
  at the time played leading role. Eventually, \emph{In Dahomey} gained such
  fame that it was requested to be played in England by King Edward VII in
  celebration Prince Edward of Wales ninth birthday celebration. This was
  monumental because a performance of this caliber had never before been
  performed before a royal audience.

  All while while was composing and concertizing famous works, he was also a
  contributin member the the Clef Club. The Clef Club was a popular music venue
  for African American Musicians in Harlem. James Reese Europe was the club's
  president. The two shared similar views in the direction that African American
  music should be taking. They both believed that their Negro music should try
  to separate themselves from white classical style. They eventually worked on a
  musical comedy, \emph{Darkydom} together.

  Will Marion Cook was admired by many whose careers he jumpstarted. One of his
  most famous students was Duke Ellington. He would often tell Duke to 'Not be
  anyone but yourself'. this not only served as solid advice for Duke, but this
  also served as Cook's own personal mantra. Cook would often give Duke lessons
  while driving around Central Park in a taxicab.

  His ambitions were too high. By the time he died on July 19, 1944, he largely
  thought that his life was unsuccessful and unfulfilling. Those who met him and
  have experienced his expertise and unique views. Most would definitely
  disagree.

  Many notable musicians, whether black or while, can trace some influence back
  to Will Marion Cook. He trailblazed a path for African Americans in Broadway.
  His belief(that he shared with Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k) that music you make should be
  deeply connected with you roots promoted a unique and unheard of style.
