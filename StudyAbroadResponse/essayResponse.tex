\section{Question 1}
Question 1: What are your personal and academic reasons for wishing to
participate in this Dialogue of Civilizations program?\\

% Answer to Question 1.
Personally, I have always wanted to visit intellectual high points in other
countries. For the most part, when I visit a new country, I travel with my
family and together, we visit the standard tourist locations. We walk the walk,
and we see the sights. For example, when I visited Dubai for a week, I saw many
attractions, which include the Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab, the man-made palm
islands, the famous indoor ski slope in the Mall of the Emirates. While all of
these sights were fascinating, and enjoyable to watch, not once did I experience
the brilliant intellectual legacy that the Arabs left us. I did not see a single
university, or museum, or place of learning. I marveled in the standard views
that every other person who walked my footsteps had seen. I wanted something
more. I wanted to see the tools that early Arab astronomers used to follow the
movements of the celestial bodies. I wanted to see the books that early
mathematicians wrote to explain the concept of zero. I yearned to appreciate the
contributions that these early intellectuals to allow us to come so far. This is
something that I hope this trip to Italy will help me to achieve. We will visit
places like the Museum of Computational Tools and Fondazione Scienza e Technica.
Both of which places that represent and portray significant human intellectual
advancements.

I also wish to experience the culture of this country without that layer of
tourist clouding my vision. When I typically visit another country, I typically
only stay for a week. That is not enough time to develop a schedule to
incorporate leisure time to truly \textit{live} in that country. To talk with
the locals, learn from them. That is what I believe it means to truly experience
a new culture.
