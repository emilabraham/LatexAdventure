\centerline{A Brief History of Jazz}

The earliest can be traced back to 1910 or very early 1920's in the city known
as "The Birthplace of Jazz", New Orleans. Although the first official recording
of instrumental jazz occurred in New York City by the Original Dixieland Jazz
Band , New Orleans really embraced and provided a receptive environment for jazz
to grow. Why New Orleans? It could be because there were many slaves and
cultures in this melting pot of a city. It could be because it was a city that
was fairly tolerant of many races and creeds. Regardless, "America's Most
Interesting City" gave birth to one of the most interesting genres of music.

The New Orleans style of jazz was known for its collective improvisation. This
means that each instrument will play a unique, often improvised part. The
instruments that make up a Jazz band were different from any other type of music
group. The frontline consisted of the coronet, trombone, and clarinet.  The
backline held the tuba, guitar, banjo, and eventually the drums. The melody was
given to the cornet.

After seeing its origins in New Orleans, jazz spread to Chicago. Chicago style
focused more on the soloists rather than the collective improve of New Orleans
style. One of the most famous cornet players was Louis Armstrong. A member of
King Oliver's band, Armstrong was a big influence in the shift from collective
improve to soloists. At this point in jazz, the piano and the saxophone were
added to the ensemble, achieving a much fuller sound.

Then along came the 1930's. Probably one of the most key decades of jazz. Many
of the most popular names in Jazz arose from this decade. Influential names like
Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, and Billie
Holiday served to pave the path for an era of jazz known as swing or big band.
An important thing to remember here, is that swing jazz is a type of dance
music. This allowed jazz to reach the ears of many brand new types of audiences.
Jazz was able to expand beyond the social restrictions of race. Many bandleaders
were prominent enough mingle with the upper echelons of white society.

During the 1940's, World War II hit. It became a little more difficult for big
bands to keep going. A shift occurred in jazz in favor of smaller groups. Out of
these smaller groups arose a genre of jazz known as Bebop.
